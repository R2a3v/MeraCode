Array  and collection 

in array >>  indexing >> ordered storing of values>> can be called by index value >> space is fixed during RunTime.
in array >> duplicate values are allowed.
in array >> we cannot delete the value but 0 can be assigned in such cases.



in collection >> Hash code is generated for each value >> cannot be called by index value >> space is flexible during RunTime.
in collection >> duplicate values are not allowed.
in collection >> algo for searching a value >> method toget to directly jump to the value.

Link List >> Updation and Deletion is very fast.

in MAP >>		MAP(key: value)		 
in MAP >> here key are defined by us while in array indexing is done by system. Key cannot be duplicated.
in MAP >> is 



TreeSet >> sorting where no duplicates are allowed .. a


String Buffer is Synchronised while StringBuilder is not.

Collection >> for each loop fixes the data and we can only read data.

Iterator moves in forward direction only while List can go both up and down direction


we cannot add string collection to a integer collection.
