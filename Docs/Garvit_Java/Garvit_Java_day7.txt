Presentation Layer	(app UI)

Service/Business Logic Layer	(service Interfaces)+(Service implementation)

Data Access Layer	(DAO Interfaces)(DAO Implementaion)

				DATABASE

DOMAIN OBJECTS(Data Transfer Objects) is centralized access to each layer by each layer.


CURD operation


static method dont need obj to get called 

System streams are 1.in 2.out 3.err 

""
IEmployeeService empService =new EmployeeServiceImpl();

security level is increased since we are taking refernce from Interface (IEmployeeService)
and it is not possible to create object in interface so we are creating object in class which is implementing it.

""

e.printStackTrace();  // this is for developer only .. if we are delivering to client we should remove this/or handle this..


  file.read()    when this is executed it read current character and moves to next.
now again when we call file.read() it will scan current moves next
if we call file.read() two time in a row without storing its value it will only store the \
last one.

InputStream filetoRead=null;
OutputStream filetoWrite=null,fie2=null;

filetoRead=new FileInputStream("abc.txt");
filetoWrite= new FileOutputStream("bcd.txt");


Reader filetoRead=null;
Writer filetoWrite=null,fie2=null;

filetoRead=new FileReader("abc.txt");
filetoWrite= new FileWriter("bcd.txt");
fie2=new FileWriter("123.txt");


BufferedReader filetoRead=null;
BufferedWriter filetoWrite=null,fie2=null;

filetoRead=new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"));
filetoWrite= new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("bcd.txt"));
fie2=new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("123.txt"));
