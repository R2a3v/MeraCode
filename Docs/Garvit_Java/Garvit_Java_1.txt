Native code of the operating system.

Compiler - JIT_COMPILER enhance the speed.

compiler creates .class format.
which is readable by the JRE.


variables - primitive eg int, String etc
		references eg  Student student; \\ which is a null


public ,private,protected


""final"" public class student(){}  writing final will restrict the further inheritance.

boolean statusAge= age>=18;


Import /Export projects as zip format.

Export as .jar and addd in run configurations..




IN eclipse :: right click >> refractor >> change the name of the variable 
						it will automatically change everywhere.


Run as debug


int x=1_00_000;    \\is same as 100000  just to improve readability.


int y=0b1010;   \\to assign as value in binary form just add 0b prefix

int Z=0x12abc;	\\to assign as value in hexa    0x

Select the code >> goto source >> format .  \\ itwill format acc to java standards/



Right click >> build path >>configure it.


Window>>Preferences >>Build path>> classpath variable
